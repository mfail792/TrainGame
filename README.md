# TrainGame

This program allows users to input their train information to see when the next train will be arriving.

The project is helpful to people because it allows them to coordinate their schedules more efficiently.  

Users can plan their next trip by inputting train name, destination, trip arrival time and frequency preference.

The program utilizes moment.js for retrieving and manipulating data entered and a firebase database to store train information server-side.
